# Foodie-Front-End---Nutritional-Recommendation
Nutritional recommender web application developed using MEAN stack
The aim of this project is to create a user friendly application that given a set of nutritional data via food items, can provide the user with nutritional analysis, results and recommendations.
 Given an array of food items by the user, Foodie will identify nutritional aspects missing or dominating in the meal such as protein or carbohydrates. By analysing the nutritional values of a meal and how it contrasts to that of recommended daily intake amounts, foods are calculated using recommender algorithms to the user, that contain the nutritional elements that will enhance the diet of the user.
The MEAN stack development framework was selected as the method of development for the application due to itsâ€™ modern and seamless connectivity from client to server.
The result is an easy to use, reliable and quick application where a user can register an account, log a meal containing any foods they require and receive accurate nutritional results and recommendations based on the collation and analysis of the data provided.
